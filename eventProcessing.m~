% Event to look for
% This function is for addition of events when you know what you are
% looking for as a marker. This means that you can add an event 200ms after
% another marker, or add in one if it is followed by another

%timing should be taking the time of the event and adding or subtracting
%% FORMAT FOR EVENTS
% Time EventMarker Frame
