# NIRS Summer Training
- The goal of this project is to become more familiar with Ted Huppart's NIRS toolbox
- This repo will contain code used to help process NIRS data through a pipeline using the NIRx scout.
- The repo is mainly just a way to share the notes and code for the individual needs of this project. The code may not be that generalizable
